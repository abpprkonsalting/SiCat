###### sicat.conf -- SiCat Configuration.
#
# Format of this file is: <Directive> <Value>, one per
#   line. Trailing and leading whitespace is ignored. Any
#   line beginning with a punctuation character is assumed to
#   be a comment.

##
# LoginTimeout - Number of seconds after a client's last
# login/renewal to terminate their connection. Defaults to 1200s = 20 minutes.
#
LoginTimeout	3600

##
# LoginGrace - Number of seconds of grace period for authentication
#
LoginGrace	180

##
# AuthServiceAddr - Required, for captive mode. Must be set to the address of
#   your authentication service. You must use an IP address
#   if DNS resolution isn't available at gateway startup.
#
AuthServiceAddr www.datalnet.com

##
# AuthServiceURL - HTTPS URL to the login script at the authservice. 
#
AuthServiceURL http://www.datalnet.com/SocialNetwork

### Network Topology
#
# FirewallPath - Where to find the firewall scripts.
#   Defaults to /usr/libexec/sicat via compile-time option.
#
FirewallPath	/usr/libexec/sicat

#
# ExternalDevice - Required if and only if NoCatAuth can't figure it out
#   from looking at your routing tables and picking the interface
#   that carries the default route. Must be set to the interface
#   connected to the Internet. Usually 'eth0' or 'eth1'
#   under Linux, or maybe even 'ppp0' if you're running
#   PPP or PPPoE.
#
ExternalDevice	eth0

##
# InternalDevice - Required if and only if your machine has more than two
#   network interfaces. Must be set to the interface connected to your local
#   network, normally your wireless card.
#
InternalDevice	br-lan

##
# LocalNetwork - Required if and only if NoCatSplash can't figure it out
#   by polling the InternalDevice. Must be set to the network
#   address and net mask of your internal network. You
#   can use the number of bits in the netmask (e.g. /16, /24, etc.)
#   or the full x.x.x.x specification.
#
LocalNetwork	192.168.1.0/24

##
# DNSAddr - Optional. *If* you choose not to run DNS on your internal network,
#   specify the address(es) of one or more domain name server on the Internet
#   that wireless clients can use to get out. Should be the same DNS that your
#   DHCP server hands out.
#
DNSAddr 192.168.1.1

##
# AllowedWebHosts - Optional.  List any domains that you would like to
#   allow web access (TCP port 80 and 443) BEFORE logging in (this is the
#   pre-'skip' stage, so be careful about what you allow.)
#
AllowedWebHosts 192.168.1.1

####### Syslog Options
#
# Log Facility - syslog or internal.  "internal" sends log messages
#    using STDERR. "syslog" sends all messages to the system log.
#
LogFacility	syslog

##
# SyslogIdent - The ident of the program that is calling syslog.  This will
#    be prepended to every log entry made by NoCat.  Defaults to NoCat.
#
SyslogIdent SiCat

##
# GatewayAddr - local address of the interface where sicat listen for clients.
# Defaults to 0.0.0.0 This is not a problem because there is a firewall rule
# in initialize.fw that drops anything coming from outside to the GatewayPort.
#
# Anyway, if there is need to stablish different internal networks, this
# variable must be filled with the local address where sicat listen for clients.

#GatewayAddr 0.0.0.0

##
# GatewayPort - The TCP port to bind the gateway 
#   service to. 5280 is de-facto standard for NoCatAuth.
#   Change this only if you absolutely need to.
#
GatewayPort     5280

####### Websocket authentication service parameters
#
##
# wsk_server_address -- Websocket authentication service address. 
#			It could be an internet address (www.abp.com) or IP (www.xxx.yyy.zzz)?
#			This variable is a must, otherwise the program exits.
#
wsk_server_address www.datalnet.com

##
# wsk_server_port --	Port on the server where the authentication service waits for clients
#			This variable is a must, otherwise the program exits.
wsk_server_port 80

##
# wsk_path_on_server -- Path on the server (to check if this is really a must)?
#			(defaults to /)
wsk_path_on_server /api/ServiceLine

##
# wsk_server_hostname -- Hostname of the server
#			(defaults to NULL)

wsk_server_hostname www.datalnet.com

##
# wsk_origin_name -- Origin name of the client (defaults to localhost)
#
wsk_origin_name localhost

##
# wsk_protocol -- The highest protocol number to test for connection with the authentication
#		service. splashd will try from up to bottom. (defaults to 0)
#					This has changed, in the code the protocol will allways be 0, the treatment
#					of the different protocols that the client and the server could use will be
#					implemented elsewere.
#wsk_protocol 0

##
# wsk_iface --	Interface where the websocket waits for connections. splashd use the websocket as a client,
#		so, this should not be neccesary. Any way it is subject to experimentation for the time being
#
wsk_iface = NULL

##
# wsk_use_ssl -- whether to use, or not, a secure connection (defaults to 0, not ussing ssl)
#
wsk_use_ssl 0	

##
# ietf_version -- -1 to ask to connect using the default, latest protocol supported, or the specific protocol ordinal
#
ietf_version -1

## Time to wait without websocket activity before closing it (in seconds). The activity monitored in this timeout are
#  specifically the messages interchanged with our protocol, not ping or pong, or other data specific to the websocket
#  protocol. (defaults 600)
wsk_time_out 600

## Time interval between keepalives connections to the websocket server (in seconds). If the websocket connection is 
#  closed because there is not activity, splashd will connect again to the websocket server when this time has passed 
#  as a mean of keepalive. (defaults 3600)
wsk_keep_alive 3600

## Log level. Determine the level of messages that are going to be send to syslog. Each level is represented by a multiple
#  of 2, ranging from 1 to 512. They can be ORED together to form the combination of several levels.

# From the libwebsockets library documentation:

#The logging apis are made available for user code.

#lwsl_err(...);
#lwsl_warn(...);
#lwsl_notice(...);
#lwsl_info(...);
#lwsl_debug(...);

#The difference between notice and info is that notice will be logged by default
#whereas info is ignored by default.

# 1   ERR 
# 2   WARN
# 4   NOTICE
# 8   INFO
# 16  DEBUG
# 32  PARSER
# 64  HEADER
# 128 EXTENSION
# 256 CLIENT
# 512 LATENCY

wsk_log_level 1

# ERR + WARN
#wsk_log_level 3

# ERR + WARN + NOTICE

# Other variables and stuff not yet implemented (or partially) but interesting for some day

# HomePage -- The authservice's notion of a default
#   redirect.
#
HomePage	http://www.datalnet.com

# DocumentRoot -- Where all of the application templates (including
#   SplashForm) are hiding.
#
DocumentRoot	/usr/share/sicat/htdocs	

##
# LogoutURL - HTTP URL to redirect user after logout.
#
LogoutURL	http://www.datalnet.com/logout.html

##
# RouteOnly - Required only if you DO NOT want your gateway to act as a NAT. 
#   Uncomment this only if you're running a strictly routed network, and
#   don't need the gateway to enable NAT for you.
#
# RouteOnly	1

##
# IncludePorts - Optional.  Specify TCP ports to allow access to when 
#   public class users login.  All others will be denied.
#
#   For a list of common services and their respective port numbers, see 
#   your /etc/services file. Depending on your firewall, you might even
#   be able to specify said services here, instead of using port numbers.
#
# IncludePorts    22 80 443

##
# ExcludePorts - Optional.  Specify TCP ports to denied access to when
#   public class users login.  All others will be allowed.
#
#   Note that you should use either IncludePorts or ExcludePorts, but not
#   both.  If neither is specified, access is granted to all ports to
#   public class users.
#
#   You should *always* exclude port 25, unless you want to run a portal
#   for wanton spam sending. Users should have their own way of sending
#   mail. It sucks, but that's the way it is. Comment this out *only if*
#   you're using IncludePorts instead.
#
# ExcludePorts 23 25 111
#
ExcludePorts    25

###### Other Common Gateway Options. (stuff you probably won't have to change)
#
# ResetCmd, PermitCmd, DenyCmd -- Shell commands to reset,
#   open and close the firewall. You probably don't need to
#   change these.
#
# ResetCmd	initialize.fw
# PermitCmd	access.fw permit $MAC $IP $Class 
# DenyCmd	access.fw deny $MAC $IP $Class 


### Fin!
