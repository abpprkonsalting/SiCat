Implementing a new approach on how to control the access of the client to Internet based on tracking the url / ips the client is requesting,
and comparing against a known table of authorized url for the phase the client is currently. This table is populated with the own DNS requests from 
the client.

The software need to have a table of known urls the client will be authorized to access during the different authentication phases. This table will be provided
by the central server using the websocket interface on device start (and probably actualized periodically). Let's say this device will implement "facebook 
authentication", then the central server will be provided a list like: www.facebook.com, m.facebook.com, p.facebook.com, etc. to populate the table. The urls of the 
central server will exist in this table always, as it will always be necessary that the client access the central server in the first stages of the auth proccess. 

When the client ask for dns information about an url, lets say www.facebook.com, the answer to the request is checked against the known urls table and if in the 
later there exists a record for that url then the ip is stored in the table. For each url in the table could be several ips, as is logic.

When later the client makes any http request, the ip packages are intercepted and it's destination address is checked against the allowed urls table, if the corresponding
url for the ip is allowed for the current authentication phase in which the client in on, then the packet is allowed. 

The previously implemented periods will continue to exist as well as the punishment functionality.


2014-09-09:

Added the "punishment" function to clients who navigate during the grace period without being authenticated. If the grace period passes and the client
has not been authenticated on the server (the device has not received the signal that the client performed the authentication correctly) the client is 
disabled for a period of time determined by the variable in the configuration file "LoginPunish" and on any attempt to connect to the internet via http, 
it's shown a page informing him that must wait for the punishment time before trying to connect again.

This function is controlled by the "AllowPunishment" variable of the configuration file, which defaults to 0 (the function of punishment).

2014-09-03:

Changed the mechanism for checking the connection time of users to the system. Now the program does not have a control of the connected users
but in the "access.fw" file, when the rules are added to iptables that allow the user to pass through the firewall, these are
setted with a validity time, using the "time" module of iptables with its variables "timestart", "timestop" and "kerneltz":

iptables -t mangle ... -m time --timestart $ start --timestop $ end --kerneltz ...
iptables -t filter ... -m time --timestart $ start --timestop $ end --kerneltz ...

This time of validity depends on whether it is in time of authentication (LoginGrace) or fully authenticated (LoginTimeOut).

This new variant allows that if the program crash, the users that are connected at that moment, are kept completely controlled, since
the connection time control is still in iptables.

4 tables were created in iptables: NoCat_Inbound0 and NoCat_Inbound1 in replacement of NoCat_Inbound in the filter table, and NoCat0 and NoCat1 in substitution
of NoCat in the mangle table. This is to selectively eliminate the rules of the users that are becoming obsolete. For this a function was created
of timeout that is executed at a time: "LoginTimeOut + 1 minute" and that changes the active tables for the insertion of the new rules. Before a table is activated, 
it is completely cleaned. That the time of change of tables is "LoginTimeOut + 1 minute" guarantees that when a table is cleaned in it there is no rule of an active user:


		LoginTimeOut + 1m			LoginTimeOut + 1m				LoginTimeOut + 1m
  -------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------
 | 	    table NoCat_Inbound0 active           |		     table NoCat_Inbound1 active	   | 		table NoCat_Inbound0 active         |
  -------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------
					    |						| |
					    |						| |
					    |_________________LoginTimeOut_______________| |
												|
					 					X user allowed in firewall	   |
											   	|
											   	|
											   	V
								Here the table NoCat_Inbound0 gets cleaned before
								been used again. The user X will have spend it's 
								connection time because it will pass more than 
								LoginTimeOut.

A check was made as to whether the program ended correctly or not before loading the firewall rules at the start of the program. This is to avoid
restarting the iptables firewall rules in case the program crash, so that the rules of active clients are maintained.

This check was implemented based on a file that is created in the / tmp directory, which in mikrotik devices is in operational memory.
The only way this file is deleted is if the device is reset (or if the program closes correctly, which should not happen during the
normal work of this).

A memory usage check was created, if it passes from a higher limit set in the memlimit variable of the configuration file the program will be
close, giving m'argen for the csicatd daemon to restart the program.
